## Overview

This tool helps you map your work activities across two dimensions:

- **X-Axis (Business Value):** How much does this task contribute to organizational outcomes?
- **Y-Axis (Personal Capability):** How well does this task align with your skills and strengths?
- **Bubble Size:** What percentage of your time does this task consume?
- **Bubble Color:** How rewarding do you find this work?
  - 🟢 Green = Highly Rewarding
  - 🟡 Yellow = Less Than Optimal  
  - 🔴 Red = Actively Dislike

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Clear the Sample Data
Click **"Clear All"** to remove the pre-populated example tasks.

### Step 2: Add Your Work Categories
Think about how you actually spend your time at work. Break it down into 8-12 distinct categories. Examples might include:

- Meetings (internal, external, 1:1s)
- Email and Slack communication
- Strategic planning
- Data analysis
- Writing reports or documentation
- Client/customer interactions
- Administrative tasks
- Project management
- Creative/design work
- Research
- Training or learning

### Step 3: Map Each Category
For each work category, either:
- **Double-click** on the chart to add a bubble at that position, or
- Click **"Add Category"** and use the sliders

For each task, assess:
1. **Business Value (0-100%):** How critical is this to organizational success?
2. **Personal Capability (0-100%):** How well does this play to your strengths?
3. **Time Allocation (1-100%):** What percentage of your time does this consume?
4. **Experience:** Is this work rewarding, tolerable, or draining?

**Note:** Your total time allocation must equal 100%.

### Step 4: Adjust and Refine
- **Drag bubbles** to reposition them on the grid
- **Drag the corner handle** of any bubble to resize (adjust time %)
- **Click a bubble** to edit its details in the side panel

### Step 5: Download Your Chart
Click **"Download Image"** to save your visualization as a PNG file.

## Interpreting Your Results

### The Four Quadrants

| Quadrant | Position | What It Means |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Highest Value** | Top-Right | High business value + high capability. This is your sweet spot—aim to spend more time here. |
| **Growth Opportunity** | Bottom-Right | High business value but low capability. Consider training, mentorship, or tools to improve. |
| **Delegate or Automate** | Top-Left | Low business value but high capability. You're good at this, but is it the best use of your time? |
| **Needs Rethinking** | Bottom-Left | Low business value + low capability. Eliminate, delegate, or radically redesign these tasks. |

### Questions to Consider

1. **Where is your time actually going?** Are your biggest bubbles in the right quadrants?

2. **What's the relationship between size and color?** If your largest bubbles are red, that's a warning sign.

3. **What's in your sweet spot?** Are you spending enough time on high-value work that energizes you?

4. **What could you delegate?** Tasks in the top-left quadrant might be good candidates.

5. **What needs to change?** Tasks in the bottom-left quadrant warrant serious reconsideration.

6. **Where should you invest in growth?** Bottom-right quadrant tasks may benefit from skill development.

## Reflection Questions

After completing your visualization, consider:

1. What surprised you about where your time actually goes?

2. If you could shift 10% of your time from one category to another, what would have the biggest impact?

3. What's one task you could delegate, automate, or eliminate this month?

4. What's preventing you from spending more time in your sweet spot?

5. How does your current portfolio align with your career goals?

## Tips for Best Results

- **Be honest:** Map how you *actually* spend time, not how you *wish* you spent it.
- **Be specific:** "Meetings" is less useful than "Status update meetings" vs. "Client strategy sessions."
- **Include everything:** Don't forget administrative tasks, email, and other "invisible" work.
- **Round reasonably:** Exact percentages aren't necessary—directionally correct is sufficient.
